# Badan Warisan Malaysia - Brand Guidelines

Use a color palette of a deep 'Heritage Green' (#0A402F) for primary buttons and headers, a 'Parchment Cream' (#FFFBEA) for backgrounds, and 'Heritage Gold' (#B48F5E) for accents. Use the 'Inter' font for all body text and 'Lora' (a serif font) for main headings. All elements should have rounded corners.
